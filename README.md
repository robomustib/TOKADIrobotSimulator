# TOKADI Robot Simulator
**The Digital Twin of the TOKADI Inclusive Robot** TOKADI is an inclusive educational robot designed to make coding and robotics accessible to all learners. This repository hosts the web-based simulation of the physical robot.
TOKADI focuses on grid-based navigation and algorithmic sequencing. However, TOKADI adds a layer of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) by incorporating emotional states and feedback, making it a unique tool for inclusive technology education.

### Educational Concept: From Screen to Floor

This simulation serves as a bridge between abstract planning and physical action:

- The "Digital Twin" Approach: Students can test their algorithms in the browser before executing them on the physical TOKADI robot.

- Resource Management: Ideal for classrooms where the number of physical robots is limited.

- Inclusive Design: Unlike standard floor robots, TOKADI integrates emotional context (e.g., recognizing emotions), combining technical skills with empathy training.


### Core Competencies Trained:

- Algorithmic Thinking (Sequencing): The game utilizes a "Command Queue" mechanic. Students must plan a sequence of up to 5 commands before execution. This strictly separates the planning phase from the execution phase, a critical concept in programming.

- Spatial Reasoning: Movement is relative to the robot's orientation (Forward, Turn Left, Turn Right), not the screen. This trains mental rotation and perspective-taking.

- Debugging: When a sequence fails, students receive immediate visual feedback, allowing them to iterate and correct their "code."

- Decomposition: The command limit forces students to break down complex paths into smaller, manageable chunks.

### Features

- 3 Progressive Levels: Increasing difficulty with different collection objectives.

- Visual Logic: Block-based movement without syntax errors.

- Keyboard Support: Fully playable via arrow keys for accessibility.

- Zero Setup: Runs directly in any modern web browser.
